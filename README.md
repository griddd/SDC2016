# SDC2016
Samples from my wireless hacking talk at SkyDogCon 2016 :)

Presentation slides are in LibreOffice and MS Powerpoint 2013 formats

Videos are going up on YouTube...mine should be there shortly.  

Update: looks like there were some problems with the recording rig; staff is working on it.  More detail at http://www.skydogcon.com/2016/11/sdc6-videos-posted.html#more

Update 2: Since there's been no further word from the SkyDogCon staff, I'm thinking the video is lost :(
